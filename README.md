# VRC Menu Merger

Merges one or more VRChat menus, parameter lists and animator controllers.

## Usage

As with any Unity plugin you should backup your Unity project before using it.

1. Import the Unity package
2. Go to PeanutTools -> VRC Menu Merger
3. Select the type of thing you want to merge (menus, parameters or animators)
4. Add all of the things you want to merge together
5. Select where you want to output the final object to
6. Click merge!

## Ideas for future

- support all animation layers (not just base)
- better nested menu merging
